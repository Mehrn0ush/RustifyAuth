Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement:
Error Handling Consistency:

Error handling across the library could be more consistent. While you are using custom error types in some places (AuthorizationError, TokenError), in others, generic errors like unwrap() are used (e.g., unwrap() in sign_token). This could lead to panics in production, so error handling needs to be strengthened.

Incomplete Storage Backends:

# // The Redis storage backend for token and code management is only partially implemented. Since Redis is critical for real-time token revocation and distributed applications, finishing this implementation would be beneficial.


Limited Use of Utilities (utils folder):

The utils folder is empty. It might be helpful to add utility functions for code generation, time-based validation, and potentially helper functions for JWT encoding/decoding that are reused in multiple places.
Security Enhancements:

CSRF protection: If you plan to add more HTTP endpoints, you might need to consider CSRF protection for the authorization flows.

Token Scopes: While scopes are used, their enforcement could be made more explicit in authorization logic.

Rate Limiting Needs Granular Control:

The current rate-limiting strategy is applied at the client level. In complex systems, rate limiting might be required at different levels (e.g., user, IP, etc.). This could be expanded to offer more fine-grained control.

Testing Coverage:

The tests are strong, but coverage for error conditions could be expanded. For example, tests for invalid tokens, expired tokens, or compromised JWTs would improve robustness.
Interoperability Between Storage Types:

When deploying in a distributed environment, using Redis for tokens and an in-memory store for authorization codes could lead to inconsistencies. A more unified approach between storage backends would improve reliability.
