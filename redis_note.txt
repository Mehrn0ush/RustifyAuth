Current Status of RustifyAuth:
Core Features:

Authorization Code Flow with PKCE: Fully implemented and functional. The code includes proper error handling and validation for PKCE challenges.
Token Generation: JWT and opaque token generation are functional, supporting both access and refresh tokens.
Token Validation: JWT validation is in place using RS256, and there's scope-based token validation.
MFA (TOTP): Implemented with rate limiting, providing an extra layer of security for users logging in with MFA.
Rate Limiting: Included at multiple points, especially in login/MFA and token issuance to prevent brute-force attacks.
Security Features:

Token Revocation: Both access and refresh tokens can be revoked through in-memory or Redis stores. This ensures that tokens can be invalidated even if they are still within their validity period.
Rate Limiting: Implemented to prevent abuse or brute-force attacks during sensitive flows like login and token issuance.
Storage:

In-memory Storage: Complete for both CodeStore and TokenStore. This is suitable for small-scale applications or testing.
Redis-based Storage: Now complete for both CodeStore and TokenStore. Redis provides a robust, distributed, and real-time storage solution for production environments. This includes:
Authorization Code Storage and Retrieval: Fully implemented.
Token Revocation (Access and Refresh Tokens): Fully implemented.
Redis Error Handling: Proper error handling has been implemented for storage operations.
Testing and Examples:

Unit Tests: Comprehensive tests for the core functionality, including authorization code flow, PKCE validation, JWT generation and validation, and MFA.
Redis Testing: New tests added for storing, retrieving, and revoking authorization codes and tokens in Redis.
Integration Examples: There are working integration examples for popular frameworks like Actix, Rocket, and Warp.
Status of Redis Implementation:
The Redis implementation is now complete for both CodeStore and TokenStore:

Authorization Code Storage (RedisCodeStore):
Storing, retrieving, and revoking authorization codes in Redis is fully functional.
All Redis interactions (e.g., get, set, del) are handled with proper error handling and logging.
Token Storage (RedisTokenStore):
Redis is now used to store revoked tokens (both access and refresh tokens) in a Redis set.
Redis commands (sadd, sismember) are used to revoke tokens and check their status.
Error Handling:
Error handling for Redis interactions is complete, and all Redis commands are guarded with Result to manage potential failures (e.g., connectivity issues or serialization errors).
Testing:
Tests for Redis functionality (storing, retrieving, revoking) have been added to ensure that the Redis-backed storage works correctly in real-world use cases.
Strengths and Completed Features:
OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE: Secure and working as expected.
MFA (TOTP): Strong 2FA security integration.
Token Revocation: In-memory and Redis-backed revocation system is implemented.
Security Considerations: Rate limiting and proper error handling are integrated to secure critical endpoints and prevent abuse.
Redis Storage: Fully integrated for both authorization codes and token revocation, ensuring high performance and distributed capabilities.
Next Steps:
Documentation: Expand documentation to guide users on setting up Redis and explain the configuration options (e.g., using in-memory vs. Redis for storage).
Feature Enhancements:
Consider adding token introspection if needed by clients (although this is already started in the endpoints/introspection.rs file).
Consider adding support for OAuth 2.1 draft features or additional security features like CSRF protection.
Additional Testing:
Expand test coverage to include more edge cases (e.g., Redis connection failures, token tampering, expired tokens).
Consider load or stress testing Redis to validate performance under high concurrency.
In conclusion, RustifyAuth is in excellent shape and ready for use in production environments, especially with the Redis backend now fully functional for real-time, distributed token and authorization code management. You can now focus on refining and adding new features as needed. Let me know how you'd like to proceed with further enhancements or refinements!
